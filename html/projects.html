        <h2>‚òï Java project using linked lists</h2>
            <p>This project was made during my fourth semester, I was tasked with making a console-based program where you would be able to insert students who had; a name, a class, a grade, etc. Then you would be able to list and sort said students according to some parameters you could choose from.</p>
        <h2>First GUI project made in C#</h2>
            <p>During my 5th semester, I started learning how to create applications that used a GUI instead of being console-based, by the end of the semester I needed to make an application that could open multiple windows, receive inputs and information from the user and validate that data.</p>
        <h2>üêç Python GUI project using MySQL databases</h2>
            <p>On my 6th semester, being my most recent one, we were working with MySQL to create and manage a database aimed to control the entry of orphans into an institute, monitor their studies and adoption applications, among other things. Later during the semester I was assigned to make a GUI app using Python that would connect with this database and offer the user an interface to input information that would be entered into the database.</p>
